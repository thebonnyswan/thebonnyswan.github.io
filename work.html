	    <h2>President, Mudd Makerspace</h2>
        <p>The Harvey Mudd Makerspace is both a student club and resource available to students who wish to work on extra-curricular projects. It is both a space where students can work, find tools, and store their projects, as well as a club, which profides funding for projects and runs workshops for students. After serving for a year as Organizational Manager of the Makerspace, I became Co-Persident of the Makerspace with another student, Andrew Bishop. In taking charge of the Makerspace, we chose to revise many of our policies, with the aim of making the Makerspace safer and more accessible. We met with chemical and facilities saftey officials within Mudd, and redeveloped the safety policies. We instituted a more secure storage system for power tools, and required a buddy system for their use, as well as making explicit the policies surrounding flammables storage and rocketry activities. In addition, we streamlined the process for acquiring funding, getting reimbursed, and submitting feedback. Finally, we collected our policies and information on an easily accessible website: <a href="http://makerspace.hmc.edu/">makerspace.hmc.edu/</a>.</p>
        <p>So far this year, we have funded more than twenty student projects involving over 50 students. Our space has granted swipe access to 212 people- roughly one fourth of the student body, and we expect that more students use the space than have formal swipe access. In my work with the makerspace I have pushed to make the space welcoming and accessible to students of all types and prior experiences levels. In revising project funding, I've included options which allow students to complete projects without waiting for reimbursement, making projects accessible regardless of income level. Our tutorials focus on building familiarity with different tools, and assume no prior knowledge. In addition, I have pushed to expand the tools and resources the Makerspace offers beyond electronics. We now have a full sewing workstation, and plan to begin a sewing machine check-out program which will allow students the time and access to work on larger, more time-intensive projects.</p>

	    <h2>Co-Organizer, MuddHacks</h2>
        <p>Worked with another student to organize and execute Harvey Mudd's 2017 Hardware Hackathon, <a href="http://muddhacks.com/">Muddhacks</a>. I worked to contact sponsors and fundraise for the event, publicize the event to students, and lead events during the hackathon. I served as a mentor to teams, especially in initial design and parts selection. Almost 60 teams participated, with a total of 217 students (of a student body of 844). I will head the organization of next year's Muddhacks.</p>

        <a id="e4proctor" class= "anchor"></a>
	    <h2>Engineering Design and Manufacturing Proctor, HMC Department of Engineering</h2>
        <p>In addition to normal duties as proctor, I worked with another proctor, Fernando Fernandez, to design two multi-class labs. The first provided an introduction to predictive modeling. Students would take experimental data of performance of different motors, and be tasked with creating models to predict which motor would most cost-effectively fulfill a task. The second was an introduction to multiple levels of prototyping. Students would become familiar with both the principle and process of 3D scanners, FDM and SLA 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC mills, and vacuforming. This would include hands-on use or demonstration of each machine, as well as cost-benefit analysis of different methods of prototyping for different quantities and materials. These labs would increase student's familiarity with predictive modeling, and give students the ability to make informed choices between methods of prototyping. While I had to relinquish this position to other responsibilities towards the end of the process, Fernando and I did all of the design and planning of these labs and their structure and learning objectives.</p>
