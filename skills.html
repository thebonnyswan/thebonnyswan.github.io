	Christian cultural elements. Using the major primary sources and the standard modern accounts
	for the period, this course will examine the key categories in which cultural change presents
	itself to the historian—the political devolution of the Roman Empire and development of
	‘successor’ states, the movement of migrant peoples, the interaction of diverse religious practices and the consolidation of the Catholic Church, material and social changes in urban society, reorientation of economy and land use, and the transmission of an intellectual culture through art and literature that was both heir to Classical tradition and aware of its own novelty." <a href="LateAntiquity.pdf">Source.</a>
